# Apigee hybrid Cloud Build Setup

If you run the Apigee hybrid quickstart from a workstation where you don't have
access to the necessary tools such as kubectl or want to create a hybrid cluster
in a GitOps pipeline, you can use this configuration that uses Google Cloud
Build to create the hybrid runtime for you.

## Prerequisites

To limit the permission scope of the Cloud Build service account we create the
required service accounts and enable all required APIs beforehand.

### Initialize project-level APIs

First you need to enable all required APIs. You can use the function in the
steps.sh file or enable them manually via the UI or API according to the [docs](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/hybrid/v1.4/precog-enableapi).

```sh
# from within the ./tools/hybrid-quickstart/hybrid14 directory
source steps.sh
enable_all_apis
```

### Create service accounts

You can use apigeectl to create the service accounts or create them manually via
the UI or API according to the documentation.

```sh
# from within the ./tools/hybrid-quickstart/hybrid14 directory
source steps.sh
set_config_params
download_apigee_ctl
create_sa
```

## Cloud Build SA Permissions

To set up the Apigee runtime the Cloud Build service account needs the following
permissions.

* Cloud Build Service Account
* Project Editor
* Kubernetes Engine Admin
* Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin
* Service Account Key Admin

You can issue them manually via the UI or with the following script:

```sh
gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com

PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe "$PROJECT_ID" --format="value(projectNumber)")

for ROLE in container.admin container.clusterAdmin editor iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin cloudbuild.builds.builder
do
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "$PROJECT_ID" \
   --member="serviceAccount:$PROJECT_NUMBER@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com" \
   --role="roles/$ROLE"
done
```

## Submit Cloud Build Job

To trigger a cloud build you can use the following command or create your own
triggers in Cloud Build.

```sh
# from within the devrel root directory
gcloud builds submit --config tools/hybrid-quickstart/cloudbuild/hybrid.cloudbuild.yaml .
```
